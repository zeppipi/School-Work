/** Latest progress
 *  + Turning the 'updateBodyView' to be more modular (Line 228)
 *  + Might be able to be done by somply having two 'updateBodyView' one for the circle and the other for squares
 * 
 *  Trello but not really
 *  + Enemy object moves
 *  + Clamp screen
 *  + Make the enemy works like a train
 *  + Give independent bodies the ability to hide and unhide on command
 * 
 *  Done:
 *  + Implement engine
 *  + Player Movement
 * 
 *  Note:
 *  1. Crocodile: can stand on its body, but not the head
 *  2. Player should fill in all goals before adding diffculty
 *  3. Snake: should show up in later diffs, goes across the safe area
 *  4. There is actually no randomness! All rows has a set pattern
 *  5. Nothing moves in a grid, this even includes the frog
 * 
 *  Report:
 *  In order to move a circle, you first make the universe. The first thing to make is 
 *  the frame updating cycle, this is done between the 'mainGameStream' and 'updateView'. 'mainGameStream' 
 *  merges all possible actions that can be done in the game into the 'currentState' to create the next state
 *  ('initialState'), then passes it to the 'updateView' to render what that next state should look like. This
 *  is done so that everything in the game can be updated only once per *frame
 * 
 *  *frame refers to the interaction between 'gameClock' and 'tick', where 'gameClock' makes a stream of 'tick'
 *   with the given interval (which right now is set to 20ms to represent how long a frame shows up in â‰ˆ60 FPS)
